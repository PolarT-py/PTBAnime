# 📹 PTBAnime

PTBAnime is a cool personal anime library manager and player built in Python using **GTK4**. Developed by two friends, [PolarT-py](https://github.com/PolarT-py) and [TBG09](https://github.com/TBG09), it's a modern (not really) and minimalist (not really) desktop app for watching and tracking your local anime collection.
